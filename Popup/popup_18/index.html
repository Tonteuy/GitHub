                    <b>The lion (Panthera leo)</b> is one of the big cats in the
                    Felidae family and a member of genus Panthera. It has been
                    listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as
                    populations in African range countries declined by about 43%
                    since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable
                    outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of
                    the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and
                    conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.
                    The West African lion population is listed as Critically
                    Endangered since 2016. The only lion population in Asia
                    survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and
                    is listed as Endangered since 1986.
